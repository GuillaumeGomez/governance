# Changes to membership


# Adding new members 
Teams may from time to time decide to add new members. Such members should be added with the expectation that they will be following the membership requirements as laid out in the team charter, and typically when they already have been doing some of this work for a while.

Teams should decide on a process for adding members. Some common processes are as follows:

### Decided by leads

With this process, new members are nominated by any team member and decided upon by the team lead(s), who may or may not loop in other team members. This is typically used in smaller teams.

### Decided by team, "no objections"

With this process, new members are nominated by any team member and decided upon by the team as a whole. The decision process requires some sense of team consensus: there should not be be team members _against_ the addition, and there should be at least some team members in favor. The team lead(s) must also be in favor. Team members should be given a reasonable period of time in which to view and respond to the nomination, however ultimately abstentions are okay, the core of this process is "no objections".

### Decided by parent team

Some subteams do not themselves decide their composition, rather it is decided by the parent team, usually by a similar process as ["no objections"](#Decided-by-team-“no-objections”).

# Removing new members

In general it is preferable that team removals happen voluntarily; any team member may remove themselves from a team if they wish. However, team removals may also occur due to inactivity according to the membership requirements laid out in the team charter, as decided by the team lead(s). For teams without leads, their parent team (or core) can be asked to perform this judgement, or they may do this via unanimous consent amongst the remaining team members.

The core and moderation teams may also request team members be removed due to misconduct.
