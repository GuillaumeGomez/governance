Teams may have participation requirements of their members. As a volunteer project, we do not want these participation requirements to become onerous and impinge on the rest of a person’s life. In general, it is okay (and encouraged) for members to take vacations from a team without losing membership status.

Members should  be sure to give their teams some notice in advance so that they may prepare if necessary.

By default, RFCs and other decisions will not be blocked on this members’ checkbox during this time. The team is free to postpone certain decisions until after the member returns. It is also acceptable for the member to request decisions on specific topics (e.g. a particular RFC) not be made until they return, provided the team is okay with it. Members may also take a “partial vacation”, where they promise to be involved in some topics but not their whole set of regular duties. For example, a member may go on vacation but promise to be involved in a particular RFC.
