Teams can have subgroups and subteams.

## Subteams

A subteam is ideally just another chartered team, not very different from a toplevel team, that manages responsibilities delegated to them by the parent team.

## Project groups

Project groups are groups which typically exist to carry out a particular one-time project. They have been defined further in [RFC 2856](http://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/2856-project-groups.html). Typically participation in a project group is [Contributorship](../membership_types.md#Contributorship), but it need not be, and this can be decided by the parent team.

## Contributor groups

Contributor groups are groups which typically exist to perform [Contributorship](../membership_types.md#Contributorship) work. They typically have low or nonexistent recurring requirements from members. These groups can be used to recognize contributions, and/or provide reviewer permissions to those people reviewing smaller changes. (and?)

## Advisory groups

Advisory groups are groups which exist to be tagged in RFCs or for other kinds of occasional reviews. Their primary goal is [Advisory](../membership_types.md#Advisory) work.
