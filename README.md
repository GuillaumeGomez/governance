# Governance Documentation

This repository aims to be the home of governance documentation, such as team
charters, for the Rust project. Currently, we are in the process of populating
this repository.

## Charter submission process

The Rust teams are in the process of writing charters this year. Currently, we
are not looking for new teams to submit charter proposals directly to this
repository; please reach out to the core team if you are interested in proposing
a new team.

For the existing Rust teams, you can take the [template](teams/_template/charter.md), and begin
filling it out. Please file issues or reach out to the core team via email if
you have questions. We'll also be reaching out to teams ourselves to help out,
but getting a head start is great.

Once you have a draft ready, we're expecting to discuss these via PRs to this
repository, so please open one, placing your file under a folder (e.g.,
`libs/libs.md` or `compiler/performance.md`).
