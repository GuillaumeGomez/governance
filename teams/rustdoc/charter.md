# Rustdoc Team Charter

**PROPOSED -- Not yet approved**

# Mission

Managing the Rustdoc documentation tool: the review process (incl. guidelines), triaging issues, overseeing the implementation and documentation.

## How does this further the Rust Project goals?

* Rust documentation is a corner stone of the Rust ecosystem.
* Keeping up with the Rust languages changes and continuously improving UX and UI.
* Keeping good communication with the Docs.rs team to sync up on Rustdoc output changes.

## Responsibilities & Commitments

### [Decision Maker](../../common/darci.md#decision-maker)

This team makes decisions on the evolution, and implementation of the Rustdoc tool.

### [Accountable for results](../../common/darci.md#accountable-for-results)

This team is accountable for ensuring:

* The generated documentation is working.
* **Rustdoc** RFCs get reviewed and shepherded in a timely manner.
* Pull requests on **Rustdoc** get reviewed in a timely manner.

### [Responsible for work](../../common/darci.md#responsible-for-work)

* Keeping its documentation (**Rustdoc** book and **Rustdoc** source code documentation) up-to-date.
* Triaging issues pertaining to **Rustdoc**.
* Reviewing pull requests.

### [Consulted for input](../../common/darci.md#consulted-for-input)

This team must be consulted for any change impacting the generation of the documentation.

### [Informed for awareness](../../common/darci.md#informed-for-awareness)

This team should be informed of language changes which should be reflected in the generated documentation.

## How does this group make decisions?

We use the [RFC process and FCPs on issues](https://github.com/rust-lang/governance/blob/master/common/rfc_fcp.md). Debates happen on [zulip](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/266220-rustdoc).

## What work is not specifically part of maintainership?

TODO

# Team Processes

## Contact Point

* #rustdoc on Zulip to communicate with the team.
* #rustdoc on Discord, although zulip is preferred and it is not very active.

## Team Membership

Team members are expected to:

* Take part in tasks the team is responsible for.
* Follow the common member requirements

Team members can take a break from these expectations as outlined in the [Vacation Policy](https://github.com/rust-lang/governance/blob/master/common/vacation_policy.md)

## How is team membership managed?

**People join the team by**: [Per the standard "by nomination & decided by team with no objections" process](../../common/membership_changes.md#decided-by-team-no-objections).

**People leave the team by**: handing in their notice (ideally at least a week) or not being involved in the team work for more than two months (outside of the vacation policy).

**People on the team are audited by**: TODO

**The current limit on number of team members is**: None.

## Where does this team work?

The team works primarily asynchronously, and communicates using the Zulip `#rustdoc` stream.
